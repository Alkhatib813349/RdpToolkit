Version 1.1 (December 24, 2020):
 - FIX: Remote Desktop Gateway servers are now implemented correctly. A profile
   usage needed to be explicitly specified, or else MSTSC would ignore it all.
 - ENHANCEMENT: Clipboard redirection is now supported.
 - ENHANCEMENT: The -Redirect parameter now supports * as a valid value, which
   will redirect everything that can be redirected.

Version 1.0.1 (October 16, 2020):
 - Well, this is embarrassing.  The module would load but do nothing on other
   computers.  I combined the ScriptsToProcess and made one giant RootModule.
   Now it's working fine.

Version 1.0.0 (October 15, 2020) was the initial release.
