SHORT DESCRIPTION
    RdpToolkit creates and manipulates Remote Desktop Connection files.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    RdpToolkit is a module for programatically creating and manipulating .rdp
    files.  These files contain connection settings to allow apps that implement
    Microsoft's Remote Desktop protocol to connect to remote computers.

Compatibility
    .rdp files are used by the Remote Desktop Connection app (mstsc.exe) built
    in to most versions of Windows. They are also used by the Microsoft Remote
    Desktop app for Windows 10, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and Android.  Many third-
    party or open-source apps should support reading a .rdp file, too.  This
    module creates .rdp files that follow the most recent specifications.  Older
    RDP clients will ignore any lines that they do not understand.

Digital Signatures
    .rdp files can have a digital signature attached.  Signed .rdp files prevent
    the user from changing most settings. In addition to this, the end user will
    see fewer warnings, and they will see the signer's name.

    The downside of this is that the digital signatures applied to .rdp files do
    not support timestamping (like Authenticode does).  Once the code signing
    certificate expires or is revoked, the .rdp file becomes unusable!  Anyone
    attempting to use it will only get an error saying the digital signature
    is invalid or cannot be verified.

    or partially supported, by this module:

EXAMPLES
    The most powerful cmdlet included with this module (at this time) is very
    likely New-RdcFile, which lets you make .rdp files.  For example:

    PS C:\> New-RdcFile -Path 'Work.rdp' -ComputerName 'WorkPC.contoso.local' `
    >> -UserName 'myaccount@contoso.com' -Redirect Drives,Cameras,AudioCapture

    As specified, this will create the file Work.rdp.  The file will connect you
    to WorkPC.contoso.local. The default username will be myaccount@contoso.com.
    On connecting, all of the local computer's drives, cameras, and microphones
    will be available in the remote session.

    If you were to do a (Get-Content 'Work.rdp'), you would see this:
        audiocapturemode:i:1
        camerastoredirect:s:*
        domain:s:
        drivestoredirect:s:*
        full address:s:WorkPC.contoso.local
        redirectsmartcards:i:0
        singlemoninwindowedmode:i:1
        use multimon:i:1
        username:s:myaccount@contoso.com

    functions in this module.
