HOW TO INSTALL RDPTOOLKIT

RdpToolkit can be installed in one of two ways. Most people will want to install
this module from PowerShell Gallery. Make sure that PowerShellGet isn't horribly
out of date (it shouldn't be), and then run this command:

    PS C:\> Install-Module -Name RdpToolkit -Repository PSGallery

If you are using PowerShell 5.1 or older, this might fail, unless you explicitly
enable TLS 1.2.


ALTERNATIVE METHOD:

Copy this entire folder into your $env:PSModulePath. You will need to update the
module manually.
